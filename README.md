# CUC24 Cascade CMS Rest API Workshop

We'll be using this repository for our CUC24 [Cascade CMS Rest API](https://www.hannonhill.com/cascadecms/latest/developing-in-cascade/rest-api/index.html) Workshop!

The [original repository](https://github.com/kuklaph/cascade-cms-api) was created by [Philip Kukla](https://github.com/kuklaph). His repository included a JS library that primarily uses NodeJS and Google Scripts but also had a vanilla JS fetch option. Although the library itself was great, the standout piece for me was the Rest API operations documentation! I had been working on my own library on and off for a couple of years now, it focuses on client side JS you can run without a lot of setup but useful enough for a few small client facing scripts. I just never had time to polish and finish it. Until now, kind of! With Philip's permission, I forked his repository, updated a few things here and there and fully replaced the library itself. If you prefer to use NodeJS and/or Google Scripts, I highly suggest you check out his [library](https://github.com/kuklaph/cascade-cms-api)!

## Cascade Documentation

You can find an openAPI representation of Cascade CMS's WSDL operations here:

https://nandoblanco.github.io/cuc24-cascadecms-restapi-workshop/swagger-ui/

All information originates from Cascade CMS's WSDL operations page. In order to access this you will need to use your organization as a subdomain followed by this url: `cascadecms.com/ws/services/AssetOperationService?wsdl`

Example: `yourOrg.cascadecms.com/ws/services/AssetOperationService?wsdl`

## General Usage

To use the library you will need to define your Cascade CMS URL and Cascade CMS [API Key](https://www.hannonhill.com/cascadecms/latest/cascade-basics/account-settings.html#APIKey) (v8.16 and later). The `apiKey` is generated in your Cascade dashboard. The `url` is `yourOrg.cascadecms.com/api/v1/` (this is the current version as of 1/9/2023).

```js
//Example
const cmsUrl = "https://xxxx.cascadecms.com/";
const cmsAPI = "xxxxx-xxx-xxxx-xxx-xxxxxx";
```

Example Operations

```js
// read asset
readAsset({
    type: "page",
    id: "page ID",
}).then(function(result) {
    console.log(result);
}).catch(function(error) {
    console.log(error);
});

// edit asset
readAsset({
    type: "page",
    id: "page ID", 
}).then(function(result) {
    result.apiReturn.asset.page.metadata.title = "NEW TITLE";
    editAsset({
        asset: result.apiReturn,
    }).then(function(result) {
        console.log(result);
    }).catch(function(error) {
        console.log(error);
    });
}).catch(function(error) {
    console.log(error);
});

```
