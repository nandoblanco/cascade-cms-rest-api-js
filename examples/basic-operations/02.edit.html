        // Note: To edit an asset, you should read it first, make your changes and then send the edited version of the asset back to the CMS

        /* Exercise 1: Edit Video Block adding new YouTube Video ID field value */

        /* Step 1.1: Locate the video block used on the index page (/blocks/video/video-1) and add asset id to line X */
        /* Step 1.2: Follow instructor's demonstration of uncommenting code starting with read only then edit related code last */

        readAsset({
            type: "block",
            id: "", // fill in

            /* Note: Result is the object the read function returns
                apiReturn is the read asset as object
                using dot notation, we drill down the object property (page XML nodes) until we reach the specific node (field) we want
                since this is a data definition block and the fields we want to edit are data definition fields, we want to look at the structure data nodes */
            // var structuredData = result.apiReturn.asset.xhtmlDataDefinitionBlock.structuredData;
            /* Note: Dot notation can get long, especially since all data in an asset is made up of nested nodes
                inside of structuredData we have data definition information and nodes where the content lives 
                all structuredData nodes are arrays of objects, even if there's only one object at the time */
            // var video = structuredData.structuredDataNodes[0];
            /* Note: Since all structuredData nodes are arrays, we need to target the first item of the array
                all arrays start with an index of ZERO so the first item of the array is ZERO not ONE
                console.log(video.identifier);
                here, we're inside the video structure data node, you can confirm that by outputting the node identifier
                inside the video node, there are 3 nodes, 1 for each field in the data definition 
                each node will the following properties: type, identifier, text, etc
                most data definition fields that take in a value will have type as text 
                the identifier is the ID you give the field in the data definition 
                the text is the actual value in the field, if the node doesn't have a text property, that means the field is empty/blank   */

            /* Note: Split each node into its own var for easy visualization but at this time, we only want to edit the video itself */
            // console.log(videoYouTubeID.text);
            /* Note: Output old videoYouTubeID */
            // videoYouTubeID.text = "As8iVB3l6uA";
            /* Note: change video YouTubeID value */
            /* Note: As an object property, it's value can be replaced 
                now the whole object is updated
                REMINDER TO SHOW "copy property path" in DEV TOOLS
                result.apiReturn.asset.xhtmlDataDefinitionBlock.structuredData.structuredDataNodes[0].structuredDataNodes[2].text = "As8iVB3l6uA";
                this could also be done without defining multiple node vars
                the array positions [] are great for data definitions that don't have any repeatable groups/fields */
